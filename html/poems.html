          the foundation of my conception of love
          when i think of what a black woman should be
          its u that i first think of
          
          u will never fully understand
          how deeply my heart feels 4 u
          i worry that we'll grow apart
          and i'll end up losing u
          
          
          u bring me 2 climax without sex
          and u do it all with regal grace
          u r my heart in human form
          a friend i could never replace."</p>

        <p class="paragraph3">Sit next to a pretty girl for an hour,
          "Solitude is painful
when one is young,
but delightful
when one is more mature.
I live in that solitude
which was painful in my youth,
but seems delicious now,
in the years of my maturity.

Now it gives me great pleasure, indeed,
to see the stubbornness
of an incorrigible nonconformist
so warmly acclaimed . . .
and yet it seems vastly strange
to be known so universally
and yet be so lonely."</p>

        <p class="paragraph3">When in love,
          There are rainbow colours,
          Springing and splashing,
          The wondrous hues of joy,
          Within your tender heart,
          Like the kiss of scented breeze!
          
          The trees look brighter and greener,
          The birds sing the sweetest melodies,
          The heart strings play a merry tune,
          And the soul dances with wonder of love,
          Life seems so awesome,
          So beautiful and precious!
